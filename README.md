# FreshCheck - Fruit and Vegetable Freshness Assessment

FreshCheck is an intelligent system designed to identify fruits and vegetables in images and provide a freshness score. This repository includes code for the API, website, and server components of the FreshCheck system.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **API Implementation**
   - Implement the API code using the provided MobileNetV2 neural network model.
   - Add additional layers to the model for classifying fruits and vegetables and generating a freshness score.
   - Set up the necessary dependencies and packages.
   - Configure the API endpoints for image processing and freshness assessment.

2. **Website Implementation**
   - Develop the website code with user-friendly interfaces for uploading or capturing images.
   - Integrate the website with the API to send image data and receive freshness assessment results.
   - Ensure seamless communication between the website and the server.

3. **Server Setup**
   - Implement the server code to handle requests and responses between the website and the API.
   - Configure the server to ensure smooth data flow and efficient functionality.

## Integration Plans

1. **Integrate the models from two different repositories.**
   - First Repository : [https://github.com/captraj/fruit-veg-freshness-ai]
   - Second Repository : [https://github.com/captraj/mobilenet-fruitsveggiesv1]

2. **Integrate two models and create an efficient API to utilize both of the models.**

## Current Challenges




## Future Plans
- **Mobile App Development**: Consider implementing a mobile application for FreshCheck, allowing users to assess fruit and vegetable freshness conveniently on their smartphones.
- **Improved Model**: Explore opportunities to enhance the freshness assessment model by incorporating advanced machine learning techniques and expanding the dataset.
- **Integration with Supply Chain Management**: Investigate possibilities for integrating FreshCheck with existing supply chain management systems to improve inventory management and quality control processes.

Please note that this README file provides an outline for the project, and the implementation steps are yet to be completed.
